DS&A: Whiteboarding, Arrays, Objects, Big O
===

## Misc
* Submit Assignment by midnight tonight
* Survey info and deadline

## Learning Objectives

1. Get comfortable writing readable code on a whiteboard
1. Learn how-to whiteboard and "why"
1. Understand differences and uses of arrays and dictionaries (maps)
1. Explain the scaling characteristics (graph shape) and give examples of: 
    * `O(1)`
    * `O(log n)`
    * `O(n)`
    * `O(n^2)`
    * `O(2^n)` 
1. Evaluate existing code to determine Big O in time or space

## Agenda

### White Boarding
* Have stations
* Supplies
    * close lid on wipes
    * erasers
    * multiple colors
    * throw away dead markers
    * let us know if running low
* Writing on a Whiteboard
    * **Exercise**
        * Write a function that takes a greeting and a number and returns the greeting repeated that many times:
            * Test Case: 
            
              In | Out
              ---|---
              `(yo, 3)` |`yoyoyo`

            * Example:

              ```
              function greet(greeting, times) {
                  const result = '';
                  for(let i = 0; i < times; i++) {
                      result += greeting;
                  }
                  return result;
              }
              ```

		* Do it multiple times (5 minutes each person) 
      * Instruction staff "signs-off"
		* Must have:
			* legible writing
            * consistent font size
            * level horizontally
			* correct indentation
            * syntactically correct
			* good scale for whiteboard

* Review best practices
    * **DEMO**: Greeting function

* Data Structures: arrays
* Demo exercise
* Exercise `one`
* Data Structures: dictionaries/maps
* Exercise `two`

* Algorithms
    * Big O
        * [Big O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)
* Exercise:
    * push/unshift
    * pop/shift
* Demo:
    * `O-n2.js`
    * `O-n-logn.js`
* Exercise:
    * (both partners) rewrite findDups to be more efficient `O(n*logn)`

    [6, 12, 3] | false
